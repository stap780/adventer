  #   # Define abilities for the passed in user here. For example:
  #   #
  #   #   user ||= User.new # guest user (not logged in)
  #   #   if user.admin?
  #   #     can :manage, :all

  #   #
  #   # The first argument to `can` is the action you are giving the user
  #   # permission to do.
  #   # If you pass :manage it will apply to every action. Other common actions
  #   # here are :read, :create, :update and :destroy.
  #   #
  #   # The second argument is the resource the user can perform the action on.
  #   # If you pass :all it will apply to every resource. Otherwise pass a Ruby
  #   # class of the resource.
  #   #
  #   # The third argument is an optional hash of conditions to further filter the
  #   # objects.
  #   # For example, here the user can only update published articles.
  #   #
  #   #   can :update, Article, :published => true
